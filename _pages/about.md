Aspiring Software Developer in my fourth year of computing science at the University of Alberta. 

Here are a few examples of my work:

✅ Worked as a developer for Zero RampUp as part of a team and created a fully functional website using JavaScript.
✅ Developed and tested an Android social media app as a developer in a Scrum environment. 
✅ Trained in machine learning and deep-learning-based machine vision methods: customized and developed models for object detection.

𝗧𝗲𝗰𝗵𝗻𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗦𝗸𝗶𝗹𝗹𝘀 & 𝗧𝗼𝗼𝗹𝘀: React, Python, Java, Android, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Docker & AI technologies!

I get excited about opportunities where I'm able to work with highly creative people to develop innovative solutions using the latest technology.
